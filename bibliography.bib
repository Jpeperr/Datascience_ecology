	abstract = {In this paper we extensively describe new software available as a R package that allows for the extraction of phenological information from time-lapse digital photography of vegetation cover. The phenopix R package includes all steps in data processing. It enables the user to: draw a region of interest ({ROI}) on an image; extract red green and blue digital numbers ({DN}) from a seasonal series of images; depict greenness index trajectories; fit a curve to the seasonal trajectories; extract relevant phenological thresholds (phenophases); extract phenophase uncertainties. The software capabilities are illustrated by analyzing one year of data from a selection of seven sites belonging to the {PhenoCam} network (http://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/), including an unmanaged subalpine grassland, a tropical grassland, a deciduous needle-leaf forest, three deciduous broad-leaf temperate forests and an evergreen needle-leaf forest. One of the novelties introduced by the package is the spatially explicit, pixel-based analysis, which potentially allows to extract within-ecosystem or within-individual variability of phenology. We examine the relationship between phenophases extracted by the traditional {ROI}-averaged and the novel pixel-based approaches, and further illustrate potential applications of pixel-based image analysis available in the phenopix R package.},

	abstract = {Phenology is a first-order control on productivity and mediates the biophysical environment by altering albedo, surface roughness length and evapotranspiration. Accurate and transparent modelling of vegetation phenology is therefore key in understanding feedbacks between the biosphere and the climate system. Here, we present the phenor r package and modelling framework. The framework leverages measurements of vegetation phenology from four common phenology observation datasets, the {PhenoCam} network, the {USA} National Phenology Network ({USA}-{NPN}), the Pan European Phenology Project ({PEP}725), {MODIS} phenology ({MCD}12Q2) combined with (global) retrospective and projected climate data. We show an example analysis, using the phenor modelling framework, which quickly and easily compares 20 included spring phenology models for three plant functional types. An analysis of model skill using the root mean squared ({RMSE}) error shows little or no difference regardless of model structure, corroborating previous studies. We argue that addressing this issue will require novel model development combined with easy data assimilation as facilitated by our framework. In conclusion, we hope the phenor phenology modelling framework in the r language and environment for statistical computing will facilitate reproducibility and community driven phenology model development, in order to increase their overall predictive power, and leverage an ever growing number of phenology data products.},

	abstract = {Rapid changes to the biosphere are altering ecological processes worldwide. Developing informed policies for mitigating the impacts of environmental change requires an exponential increase in the quantity, diversity, and resolution of field-collected data, which, in turn, necessitates greater reliance on innovative technologies to monitor ecological processes across local to global scales. Automated digital time-lapse cameras – “phenocams” – can monitor vegetation status and environmental changes over long periods of time. Phenocams are ideal for documenting changes in phenology, snow cover, fire frequency, and other disturbance events. However, effective monitoring of global environmental change with phenocams requires adoption of data standards. New continental-scale ecological research networks, such as the {US} National Ecological Observatory Network ({NEON}) and the European Union's Integrated Carbon Observation System ({ICOS}), can serve as templates for developing rigorous data standards and extending the utility of phenocam data through standardized ground-truthing. Open-source tools for analysis, visualization, and collaboration will make phenocam data more widely usable.},

	abstract = {Gaining a better understanding of global environmental change is an important challenge for conserving biodiversity. Shifts in phenology are an important consequence of environmental change. Measuring phenology of different taxa simultaneously at the same spatial and temporal scale is necessary to study the effects of changes in phenology on ecosystems. Camera traps that take both time-lapse as well as motion-triggered images are increasingly used to study wildlife populations. The by-catch data of these networks of camera traps provide a potential alternative for measuring several climatic and phenological variables. Here, we tested this ability of camera traps, and quantified climatic variables as well as the timing of changes in plant and animal phenology. We obtained data from 193 camera-unit deployments during a year of camera trapping on a peninsula in northern Sweden aimed at studying wildlife. We estimated daily temperature at noon and snow cover using recordings provided by cameras. Estimates of snow cover were accurate, but temperature estimates were higher compared with a local weather station. Furthermore, we were able to identify the timing of leaf emergence and senescence for birches (Betula sp.) and the presence of bilberry berries (Vaccinium myrtillus), as important food sources for herbivores. These were linked to the timing of the growth of antlers and the presence of new-born young for three ungulate species as well as the presence of migratory Eurasian cranes (Grus grus). We also identified the timing of spring and autumn moulting of mountain hares (Lepus timidus) in relation to snow cover. In this novel study, we show the potential of (by-catch) data from camera traps to study phenology across a broad range of taxa, suggesting that a global network of camera traps has great potential to simultaneously track wildlife populations and the phenology of interactions between animals and plants.},

	abstract = {The genus Spodoptera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) includes some of the most infamous insect pests of cultivated plants including Spodoptera frugiperda, Spodoptera litura, and Spodoptera exigua. To effectively develop targeted pest control strategies for diverse Spodoptera species, genomic resources are highly desired. To this aim, we provide the genome assembly and developmental transcriptome comprising all major life stages of S. exigua, the beet armyworm. Spodoptera exigua is a polyphagous herbivore that can feed on \&gt; 130 host plants, including several economically important crops. The 419 Mb beet armyworm genome was sequenced from a female S. exigua pupa. Using a hybrid genome sequencing approach (Nanopore long-read data and Illumina short read), a high-quality genome assembly was achieved (N50 = 1.1 Mb). An official gene set (18,477 transcripts) was generated by automatic annotation and by using transcriptomic {RNA}-seq datasets of 18 S. exigua samples as supporting evidence. In-depth analyses of developmental stage-specific expression combined with gene tree analyses of identified homologous genes across Lepidoptera genomes revealed four potential genes of interest (three of them Spodoptera-specific) upregulated during first- and third-instar larval stages for targeted pest-outbreak management. The beet armyworm genome sequence and developmental transcriptome covering all major developmental stages provide critical insights into the biology of this devastating polyphagous insect pest species worldwide. In addition, comparative genomic analyses across Lepidoptera significantly advance our knowledge to further control other invasive Spodoptera species and reveals potential lineage-specific target genes for pest control strategies.},
